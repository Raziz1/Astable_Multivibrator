# Astable_Multivibrator ðŸš¨
An astable multivibrator circuit designed in Altium Designer

To design the circuit I used the following online guide for an [astable multivibrator circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-BwTmkiMdA&list=PLakVZ0BpR4sJ6X_1DzXHXROfP__xrr5UG&ab_channel=TheEngineeringMindset)

## Introduction
An Astable Multivibrator (Also known as the flip-flop circuit) is a circuit that continuously oscillates between two states. Using transistors, capacitors, and LEDs we can build a circuit to demonstrates its function. 

## Requirements
* The transistor needs approximately 0.7V at the base pin to turn on
* Since we are using a 3V supply we will need to use an LED with a low forward voltage (Red & Yellow)
* The arrangmenet of LEDs will be in parallel so that they all have an equal voltage drop 
* I will place a resistor in series with the LED to protect the LED from burning out
* Our targe current for each LED will be 10mA (In parallel that is a total of 50mA) so we will need a 24 ohm resistor 
* I will be using an NPN transistor for this application

## Capacitor Charge time 
In this circuit the capacitor charge time determines how quickly the LED oscillates. We can adjust
